It has throughout the whole project been important to both of us authors to be involved with each part of the work as far as possible.. %As a result, both authors have contributed equally to the full work. However, when deemed that we would achieve better results from assigning a certain task to one person, we ensured that the other person at least retained full insight into every detail of the process. An example of such a task is the coding part of the implementation, where David has written most of the code for the pre-processing of the data, while Tobias has written most of the code for the setting up and training of the network.
